1) Description:

The main objective of this part is to generate the data based on the Wisconsin benchmark specification. We created three tables namely ONEKTUP which contains 1000 tuples, TENKTUP1 and TENKTUP2 which contains 10,000 tuples in each table. We generated the data using a script developed in java. The scripts generates the data and inserts the data directly to the PostgreSQL.


2) Which system you will be working with and why you chose it?

We are using PostgreSQL for this project. It is very reliable and is easy to use we did our CS586 project in PostgreSQL so we are quite comfortable using it. We used Java for generating the data. 


3) Demonstrate you have loaded data into that system

CSV files above are extracted from the PostgreSQL select queries. 


4) Include lessons learned or issues encountered

We have gone through Wisconsin benchmark specification and got to know about what the attributes are what they hold. We learned how to connect a java program to the PostgreSQL. We did faced a lot of issues while trying to connect our java program to the database. We spent a lot of time for generating the string4 value.
